In the Room, anyone can make questions and upvote others people questions.


## 🚀 Getting Started

### Pre-requirements 📋

To run this project you will need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (I've used version `v18.17.1` while writing this doc)

**Note:** When installing Node.js, npm is automatically installed. 🚀

### 🌲 Environment Variables
Make a copy of the `env.template` file and rename it to `.env`  
Change the variables inside `.env` with the credentials of your database

### Installation 🏗️
To install the dev dependencies, run 
```sh
`npm install -f
```
> [!NOTE]  
> I'm using [React 19](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19) on this project.
> You need to use `-f` to force install because some of dependecies require React 18 and will give some warnings.

And run the App with 
```sh
npm run dev
```
